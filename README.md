# burntcustards-aliases

A `.bash_aliases` file that includes a bunch of shortcuts, workarounds, and anything else I can shove in it.


Also includes a .gitconfig file with my user settings and some git aliases.


### Linux (or bash shell on Win10) install
Download the aliases file to your `$HOME` directory (short URL via [my website](http://burnt.io)):
```
$ wget -O .bash_aliases aliases.burnt.io
```
Close and repoen the terminal window, or run `exec bash`, and you're done!


### macOS install
TODO: Mac instructions.


Some of my personal and/or work aliases aren't included, as they contain client-related info, or are just too obscure to be useful to anyone but me. If you're interested in something you've seen me use that isn't here, ask me about it on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/burntcustard).
